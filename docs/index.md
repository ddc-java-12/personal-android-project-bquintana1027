## Device/external services

Tag entry system 
  - which would allow us to create entries with multiple tags. We could then view each tag by project, client etc. This would also allow us to list time entries by tag within certain date ranges. 

Google Calender API
 - https://developers.google.com/calendar
 - I believe I could use Google Calendar API as the primary calendar the app would use to track activity across pages. 
   
Timing Logger
- https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/TimingLogger
- Not sure if this is considered an external service if this API is created by Android Developers. But the ability to track time across multilpe events & dates is a core element to making this application work. 


## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

- Ability to track hours for a project over a weekly or bi weekly period and produce invoice based on the services and hours rendered.
